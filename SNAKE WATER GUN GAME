# You have to use a random choice function to select snake, water, and gun.
# You do not have to use a print statement in case of the above function.
# Then you have to give input from your side.
# After getting ten consecutive inputs, the computer will show the result based on each iteration.
# You have to use loops(while loop is preferred).
